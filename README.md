Building the Google home page. Have done some Udemy course and FCC so have a good grasp on a lot of the basics.

Feb 09 pm to-do: Get rid of text-field focus property

Feb 09 pm: Height between searchbar and footer??

Feb 10 am: Height again between searchbar and footer. Used with flex-shrink and flex-grow?


Project is complete and looks visually very similar. Upon inspection of the source-code found the flex-shrink and flex-grow property which i believe was used to set the height of the viewport. Need to investigate further.

Overall the project was tougher than I expected, even though I had had some prior experience. Goes to show following a tutorial and doing it on your own really puts you to the test. Look forward to seeing the challenges ahead.
